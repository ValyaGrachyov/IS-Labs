Israel's missile and artillery attack killed more than 400 Palestinians, including 263 women and children,&#91;9&#93; making it one of the deadliest in the Gaza war.&#91;10&#93; Dubbed Operation Might and Sword (Hebrew: מבצע עוז וחרב, Oz VaHerev&#91;11&#93;) by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), it was carried out in coordination with the United States.&#91;1&#93; On 19 January 2025, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to a three-phase ceasefire agreement with Hamas; under the agreement, all Israeli hostages would be released by the end of the second phase and the Gaza war would permanently end. After the first phase ended on 1 March, Hamas maintained on moving to the second phase – as envisioned in the original ceasefire deal – while Netanyahu and the Trump administration insisted on renegotiating the terms.&#91;12&#93; Israel also refused to withdraw from sites in Gaza even though it had agreed to do so in the ceasefire agreement.&#91;12&#93; Further, during the ceasefire, Israel killed more than 140 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.&#91;12&#93; In March, Israel prevented all food and medicine from entering Gaza;&#91;13&#93; later it shut off electricity to Gaza's main desalination plant, effectively cutting off water.&#91;14&#93; These actions have been deemed war crimes.&#91;14&#93;&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; On 18 March, at 2 a.m., the Israeli military began a massive surprise attack on various parts of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, Khan Yunis, and Rafah.&#91;17&#93; The attacks killed more than 413 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza Health Ministry.&#91;18&#93;&#91;17&#93;&#91;19&#93; The airstrikes struck homes and set at least one tent camp on fire.&#91;13&#93; Hospitals were overwhelmed by dead and wounded.&#91;13&#93; The IDF stated that the strikes targeted leadership figures, mid-ranking military commanders, and operational infrastructure of Hamas.&#91;17&#93; This has been disputed by experts,&#91;who?&#93; who believe Israel "indiscriminately attacked" the Gaza Strip.&#91;2&#93;&#91;3&#93;&#91;4&#93; Several entire families were killed off in the attacks.&#91;20&#93; Hamas condemned the strikes as a violation of the ceasefire, accusing Israel of endangering hostages held in Gaza,&#91;17&#93;. Hamas began responding militarily to the Israeli strikes on 20 March by firing rockets at Tel Aviv.&#91;21&#93;&#91;6&#93; The Israeli government said it carried out the attack in response to Hamas's refusal to extend a ceasefire through additional hostage releases. Hamas had agreed to the second phase of the original ceasefire agreement, under which Israeli hostages would have been released in exchange for a permanent end to the Gaza war.&#91;22&#93;&#91;12&#93;&#91;23&#93; The Israeli government did not consider their attack to be a breach of the ceasefire agreement, arguing that there was "no automaticity" between the phases.&#91;24&#93; The escalation prompted international reactions, with the United Nations Security Council convening an emergency session to address the crisis.&#91;17&#93; Background Further information: 2025 Gaza war ceasefire In mid-January 2025, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect, pausing the Gaza war.&#91;25&#93; The terms of the ceasefire deal included three phases: the first phase involved a limited Israeli-Palestinian prisoner exchange as well as increased aid into the Gaza Strip, the second phase would complete the prisoner exchange and mark the end of the war, and the third phase would involve the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.&#91;26&#93; The details of the second phase were to be negotiated, but the Biden administration had it made it clear that the first phase of the ceasefire would continue until the second phase could be agreed upon.&#91;27&#93; Despite the ceasefire, the Israel Defense Forces have carried out strikes on the Gaza Strip that have killed over 150 people, including many children, &#91;28&#93; in stark violations of the ceasefire. Israel has been identified by Amnesty International as committing genocide in Gaza.&#91;29&#93;&#91;30&#93; Instead of continuing to the second phase of the ceasefire, as agreed upon in the original agreement, Israel instead insisted on a "new plan" (called the "Witkoff plan" after Steve Witkoff) in which Hamas would release the Israeli captives in exchange for a 50-day extension of the ceasefire, with Israel retaining the option of returning to war.&#91;26&#93; The Witkoff plan is not what Israel and Hamas had agreed to in January,&#91;26&#93;&#91;31&#93; meaning Israel effectively "reneged on the ceasefire deal" by refusing to move to the second phase of the ceasefire.&#91;32&#93; CBS News writes that some of the Trump's and Netanyahu's proposals also contradicted the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal.&#91;31&#93; Hamas insisted on the full implementation of the ceasefire deal agreed upon in January.&#91;22&#93; The Israeli government and the United States insisted on renegotiating the original ceasefire deal. Israel cast Hamas's preference for sticking to original deal as a "refusal" to extend the ceasefire.&#91;12&#93;&#91;23&#93; Israel's new proposal was to extend the original ceasefire in exchange for more prisoner exchanges; however, this extension was not part of the January ceasefire agreement.&#91;23&#93; US National Security Council spokesman asserted that Hamas "could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war."&#91;17&#93; According to Palestinian officials, the Israel Defense Forces violated the ceasefire hundreds of times, carrying out strikes on the Gaza Strip that had killed over 100 people.&#91;33&#93; Among those killed, they said, were "civilians who were collecting firewood or checking on their homes."&#91;25&#93; On the other hand, Netanyahu and Israeli officials have claimed that Hamas violated the ceasefire several times by using hostages for rituals and propaganda.&#91;34&#93; In addition, Gideon Sa'ar, Israel's foreign minister, claimed, without providing evidence, that Hamas has violated the agreement by seizing aid supplies for itself. Hamas has denied this allegation.&#91;24&#93; On 2 March, shortly after the beginning of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, Israel shut down the entry of all humanitarian aid (including food and fuel) into the Gaza Strip. A few days later, Israel cut off electricity supply to Gaza Strip's main desalination plant, which provided drinking water for 500,000 Palestinians.&#91;35&#93; Amnesty International said that shutting off all food and water indicated Israel had a policy of imposing conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinian people – which is tantamount to genocide (see Gaza genocide).&#91;15&#93;&#91;16&#93; Médecins Sans Frontières said depriving Palestinians of drinking water was a war crime.&#91;14&#93;&#91;16&#93; On 17 March and 18 March, Israeli officials stated that Palestinian militants, including Hamas, were building up their military capabilities and preparing for offensives against Israeli communities and Israeli soldiers in Gaza.&#91;36&#93; Israel did not provide any evidence for these claims.&#91;23&#93; Hamas denied these allegations.&#91;23&#93; Israeli domestic politics Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced pressure from far-right members of his coalition to resume war against the Gaza Strip.&#91;23&#93; Throughout the war, members of Netanyahu's coalition have called for the permanent conquest of Gaza and re-establishment of the Jewish settlements.&#91;37&#93; Netanyahu has thus far resisted those calls, and when he signed the ceasefire agreement in January, the Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir left Netanyahu's coalition.&#91;37&#93; After Israel attacked Gaza on 18 March, Ben-Gvir rejoined the coalition.&#91;23&#93; Opposition members accused Netanyahu and his government of failing to eliminate Hamas and allied groups' military capabilities or rescue the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza.&#91;38&#93; Netanyahu's critics have said that the 18 March attacks are a result of Netanyahu's legal troubles.&#91;12&#93; Netanyahu was scheduled on 18 March to testify in his corruption trial, but as a result of the attacks, the legal proceedings were postponed.&#91;39&#93; Expulsion of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip See also: Potential American ownership of the Gaza Strip and Nakba On 4 February 2025, Trump announced an intention to "take over" and "own" the Gaza Strip.&#91;40&#93; Trump proposed that Gaza's 2 million Palestinians be permanently relocated from the Gaza Strip.&#91;41&#93; This plan was supported by Netanyahu but condemned by human rights experts as a violation of international law.&#91;41&#93; The 18 March attacks were done with Trump's approval.&#91;41&#93; The Israeli Nachala organization had repeatedly called for Netanyahu to defeat Hamas and expel Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.&#91;42&#93; Attacks 18 March The attacks began on 18 March 2025, at approximately 2:20 a.m. local time during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.&#91;43&#93;&#91;44&#93;&#91;45&#93; Following a ceasefire instituted around two months prior, the Israeli strikes of 18 March 2025 were a surprise attack,&#91;8&#93; with the Israeli military stating that their attack "plan was kept in closed circles in the IDF to create an element of surprise and deception."&#91;46&#93; Israeli warplanes began entering Gaza at 2:30&#160;a.m.,&#91;47&#93; and the Israel Defense Forces announced on Telegram that it and the Israeli Security Agency were "conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization in the Gaza Strip".&#91;28&#93; According to the Associated Press, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the strikes after ceasefire talks appeared to stall.&#91;48&#93; The strikes have targeted Rafah, Khan Yunis, Deir al-Balah, Nuseirat, Bureij, Al-Zaytoun, Al-Karama, and Beit Hanoun, according to the IDF.&#91;49&#93; Al Jazeera reported strikes in Al-Mawasi, Rafah.&#91;50&#93; An unidentified Israeli military official stated to Reuters that they would continue the attacks indefinitely, and would incorporate further military elements beyond airstrikes.&#91;51&#93; An Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza stated that heavy shelling from Israeli tanks targeted eastern sections of Abasan, Khan Yunis. Six family members travelling in a car in Abasan were killed in one of the strikes.&#91;51&#93; The shelling reportedly killed thirteen people. One strike in Rafah reportedly killed seventeen members of a single family.&#91;52&#93; The Al-Tabi'in School in Gaza City, which was sheltering refugees at the time of the attacks, was struck, causing segments of the building to collapse. A Gaza City prison in the Al-Shati refugee camp was hit in an airstrike, collapsing the building and killing over thirty-six prisoners and prison guards.&#91;10&#93; 19 March The attacks continued at 6 p.m. into the early hours of 19 March. Israel launched attacks on Rafah and Khan Yunis, killing fourteen people and killing a mother and her child sheltering in a tent encampment. A strike against a five-story tall residential structure in northwestern Gaza City reportedly resulted in the building's complete collapse. Gaza's Civil Defence estimated that thirty people were in the building at the time of the strike, and pulled out three bodies and one survivor with critical injuries. Heavy artillery fire was reported in eastern Gaza City.&#91;53&#93; According to an official of the UN, a UN guesthouse was hit by a non-accidental strike. Israel denied reports of targeting the building.&#91;54&#93; 20 March In the early morning hours of 20 March, Israel launched several attacks on the Gaza Strip, reportedly killing at least 80&#91;55&#93; Palestinians. Areas where attacked were launched included Bani Suheila, Abasan al-Kabira, al-Fukhari, Mosbeh, and Beit Lahia, resulting in at least eleven residential structures being "flattened". Many of the areas hit were family residences, resulting in the deaths of women, children, newborn infants, and men who had been sleeping at the time of the attacks. The Gaza Health Ministry stated that the number of deaths rose to 591 since 18 March, with 1,042 reported injuries.&#91;7&#93; Ground operations On 18 March, the IDF initiated a "focused ground operation" in central Gaza with the intention of expanding the area of a buffer zone and to re-take the Netzarim Corridor bisecting the Gaza Strip. On 19 March, the IDF announced the operation publicly, and partially recaptured the center of the Netzarim Corridor.&#91;53&#93;&#91;56&#93; The re-capture of the corridor prevented the movement of Palestinians between the northern and southern sections of the Gaza Strip.&#91;53&#93; Blockade on humanitarian supplies Further information: Gaza humanitarian crisis (2023–present), Humanitarian aid during the Gaza war, and Israeli blockade of aid delivery to the Gaza Strip Before, during and after the strikes, Israel implemented a total blockade on all humanitarian supplies, including food, water, medications and medical supplies, cooking materials, and other essential goods. Several requests made by the United Nations Security Council to collect and distribute aid left at the Karem Shalom border crossing were "systematically denied". In addition, Israel cut off power to the desalination plant in southern Gaza, restricting the availability of clean water for about 600,000 people. The blockade on commercial goods led to surging prices of staple foods, with prices for vegetables tripling in North Gaza and at least six World Food Programme-subsidized bakeries being forces to close as a result of lacking cooking supplies and gas.&#91;51&#93; On 19 March, OCHA reported that Israel had blocked medical equipment front entering into Gaza, including 20 ventilators for neonatal intensive care units and nine portable newborn incubators.&#91;57&#93; In addition, Israel initiated movement restrictions against Palestinians at almost 1,000 roadblocks and checkpoints in the West Bank. The restrictions reportedly forced civilians to make hazardous detours or wait for several hours in queue, significantly impacting the operations of businesses in the West Bank.&#91;51&#93; Casualties At least 413 people have been killed, including 174 children.&#91;18&#93;&#91;58&#93;&#91;59&#93; The Gaza Health Ministry reported that more than 560 people were injured due to the attacks.&#91;17&#93; Of the 404 fatalities, 263 of those killed were women and children.&#91;9&#93; The high death toll made the 18 March attacks as the deadliest day for Palestinians since the Gaza war's beginning in October 2023.&#91;10&#93; By 20 March, the casualty toll rose to 591 dead and 1,042 injured.&#91;7&#93; The Gaza Strip's Government Media Office stated that most of the casualties were women, the elderly, and children; reporting that "entire families" had been killed. The office said that the attacks were tactically designed to destroy the will of the Gazan population, and urged the international community to stop the attacks and hold Israeli officials accountable.&#91;51&#93; An Israeli airstrike on the United Nations headquarters in Gaza City killed one foreign national and injured four other people.&#91;60&#93; Issam al-Da'alis, whose position is akin to the Prime Minister of Gaza, was killed in the attacks on 18 March. Other government officials killed included: Mahmoud Abu Watfa (undersecretary of the Interior Ministry of the Gaza Strip), Bahjat Abu Sultan (chief of internal security), and Ahmed Omar al-Hatta (undersecretary of Justice Ministry of the Gaza Strip).&#91;61&#93; Palestinian Islamic Jihad spokesman Abu Hamza was also killed in the airstrikes.&#91;62&#93;&#91;63&#93; In addition, Hamas also reported the deaths of Yasser Harb and M. Muhammad al-Jamasi, members of its political bureau.&#91;64&#93; Muhammad Abu Salmiya, the director of the al-Shifa Hospital, reported that during the emergency response to the attacks, an injured victim died "every minute" in the hospital due to a lack of healthcare supplies. He stated that between Gaza City and North Gaza, only four intensive care beds were available, and that attempts to reach injured victims beneath the rubble were "extremely difficult".&#91;51&#93; Over seventy people were reported injured in central Gaza.&#91;65&#93; Aftermath Forced displacement Further information: Gaza Strip evacuations and Israeli war crimes in the Gaza war §&#160;Forced evacuation The IDF ordered all civilians in the areas of eastern Gaza to leave and move towards its center.&#91;10&#93; The areas placed in displacement orders included Beit Hanoun in North Gaza, as well as Abasan al-Kabira, Abasan al-Saghira, and Khuza'a in Khan Yunis.&#91;52&#93; Gaza responses The Education Ministry in the Gaza Strip ordered the suspension of classes in dozens of schools.&#91;10&#93; Reactions The regional mediators intensified diplomatic efforts to broker a renewed truce.&#91;17&#93; The US reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense and attributed responsibility to Hamas for the failure to extend the ceasefire through hostage negotiations.&#91;17&#93; The White House released a statement saying that Hamas and other regional entities "will see a price to pay," reiterating that "All hell will break loose."&#91;66&#93; Palestine Hamas official Izzat al-Risheq stated that "Netanyahu's decision to resume war" was "a decision to sacrifice the occupation's prisoners and impose a death sentence on them".&#91;3&#93; A senior official of Hamas stated to Reuters that the renewed attacks represented Israel's unilateral termination of the ceasefire started in January 19. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) characterized Israel as "deliberately sabotaging all efforts to reach a ceasefire" to restart its "war of extermination" on Gaza. The paramilitary group called Netanyahu's cabinet a "bloodthirsty Nazi government", and vowed that the cabinet will fail to achieve their objectives.&#91;51&#93; Hamas official Taher al-Nunu described the attacks as a "moral test" for the international community, based on whether it would allow the bombardments on civilians to go on, or if it acted to stop the violence towards Palestinian civilians.&#91;52&#93; Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv on 20 March, explaining that it did not immediately respond to the strikes in order to give mediators more time to pressure Israel to cease its attacks, but then decided to "give indications that it can respond" as the assault and death toll rose.&#91;21&#93;&#91;55&#93; Israel Israeli defense minister Israel Katz said that Israel has "returned to fighting in Gaza".&#91;65&#93; He further stated that if Hamas did not release all held captives in Palestinian territory, that Israel would open the "gates of hell" on Gaza, and would discharge forces that Hamas "have never known before".&#91;51&#93; Israel indefinitely shut down the Rafah Border Crossing during the attacks.&#91;67&#93; Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement on X, claiming that Hamas persistently refused to release Israeli hostages kidnapped during the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel while rejecting all proposals offered by mediators and United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff.&#91;68&#93; Foreign Minister of Israel Gideon Sa'ar stated that Israel was given "no choice" but to break the ceasefire agreement due to stalling negotiations and the cessation of hostage returns by Hamas in the two and a half weeks prior to the attacks. He described the situation as a "deadlock" where "nothing would move" without further action. He also stated that the military operation initiated by the strikes would not be limited to a single day.&#91;51&#93; On 19 March, Israeli media reported that while some described the resumption of airstrikes as being a result of a "collapse", the ceasefire was deliberately collapsed by the Israeli government itself.&#91;69&#93; International &#160;Australia: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated after the attacks in Gaza that "There's already been enormous suffering there, which is why we're calling upon all parties to respect the ceasefire and hostage deal that was put in place," he further stated that "We'll continue to make representations. Australia will continue to stand up for peace and security in the region".&#91;3&#93; &#160;Bangladesh: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Israel's renewed military aggression in Gaza, stating, "This has caused extensive civilian casualties, particularly among women and children, and further deteriorated the humanitarian situation." Bangladesh further urged Israel to stop military actions, follow international law, and called on the UN and global community to act swiftly to end violence, protect civilians, and ensure aid reaches Gaza.&#91;70&#93;&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93;&#91;73&#93; &#160;Belgium: Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot stated on Twitter, calling for both parties to implement the second phase of the agreement, "which must pave the way for reconstruction and peace for all", further condemning the "new Israeli strikes and their heavy human toll", adding that Israel's blocking of humanitarian aid to Palestinians was "a serious violation of international law".&#91;3&#93; &#160;Chile: The Chilean government condemned the "brutal attack against the civilian population of Gaza" and called for a ceasefire.&#91;74&#93; &#160;China: Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing was "highly concerned" about the attacks, calling for parties to avoid any actions "that could lead to an escalation of the situation, and prevent a larger-scale humanitarian disaster".&#91;3&#93; &#160;Colombia: The Colombian government condemned the "indiscriminate" attack, saying it "jeopardized" the ceasefire, which Colombia urged to be maintained.&#91;75&#93; &#160;Egypt: The Egyptian government which is acting as a mediator alongside Qatar and the US, called the Israeli attacks a "flagrant violation" of the deal with the foreign ministry calling the attacks a "dangerous escalation which threatens to have bring serious about consequences for the stability of the region".&#91;3&#93; &#160;France: The foreign ministry condemned the attacks, calling for "an immediate end to hostilities, which are jeopardizing efforts to free the hostages and threatening the lives of the civilian population in Gaza".&#91;3&#93; During a meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah II, President Emmanuel Macron called the attacks a "dramatic step backwards".&#91;76&#93; &#160;Germany: Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the Israeli attacks is a "cause for great concern", further stated that "The images of burning tents in refugee camps are shocking. Fleeing children and internally displaced persons must never be used as leverage in negotiations".&#91;3&#93; &#160;Iran: A Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated the US had direct responsibility for "the continuation of genocide in the occupied Palestinian territories".&#91;3&#93; &#160;Ireland: Prime Minister Micheál Martin condemned the Israeli attacks on Gaza and called on all parties to respect the ceasefire and the agreement to release hostages and return to negotiations "for the sake of all the civilians in Gaza, who have already endured unimaginable hardships, there must be an urgent end to all hostilities".&#91;3&#93; &#160;Italy: Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the Israeli attacks on Gaza put the prospect of a deal to release the captives at risk, during her speech on the Italian senate she said that "We are following with great concern the resumption of fighting in Gaza… which jeopardizes the objectives we are all working towards: the release of all hostages and a permanent end to hostility, as well as the restoration of full humanitarian assistance in the Strip.&#91;3&#93; &#160;Jordan: Government spokesman Mohammed Momani said that Jordan has been following Israel's "aggressive and barbaric bombing of the Gaza Strip" and understands the need to stop it.&#91;3&#93; During a meeting with French president Macron in Paris, King Abdullah II has called the attacks and the blockade of humanitarian aid a "dangerous escalation" that could threaten the lives of civilians.&#91;77&#93; &#160;Lebanon: Hezbollah condemned the continuation of Israel's "war of termination" and reaffirms its support for Gaza.&#91;78&#93; &#160;Malaysia: Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim condemned the air strike that killed aid workers from Malaysian Consultative Council of Islamic Organisations (MAPIM) who were carrying out a humanitarian mission in Gaza.&#91;79&#93; &#160;Netherlands: Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp stated on Twitter that "all hostilities must end permanently", he stated that all parties should "respect the terms of the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal.
