The first wave of attacks were against Houthi radars, air defenses, and missile and drone systems in the country.&#91;4&#93; According to the US Central Command, the attacks mark the beginning of an extensive operation,&#91;3&#93; aiming to restore security in the Red Sea, which had been disrupted for months from Houthi attacks on commercial and military vessels.&#91;4&#93; Since the outbreak of the Gaza War, the Yemen-based Houthis conducted over 190 attacks on shipping,&#91;5&#93; sinking two vessels, seizing another, and killing at least four seafarers, as part of an attempt to force a ceasefire in the Gaza War and an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza via economic pressures.&#91;3&#93; The group has also fired ballistic missiles and drones on Israeli cities, killing one civilian in Tel Aviv.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; In response, the US, UK, Israel, and a multinational coalition, launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, a series of strikes on Yemen.&#91;8&#93;&#91;5&#93; Donald Trump warned that any future Houthi attacks would be seen as acts of aggression by Iran, holding the country accountable and threatening severe consequences.&#91;9&#93; Background[edit] This section needs expansion&#32;with: Information about US support for Israel in the Gaza War. You can help by adding to it. (March 2025) Map of Houthi activity near the Yemeni coast as of 16 June 2024: &#160; Supreme Political Council (Houthi Movement) &#160;&#160;Presidential Leadership Council (UN-recognized government of Yemen) &#160;&#160;&#160;Houthi strikes (red) and hijackings (blue) The Houthis are a Shia Islamist militant group located in Yemen,&#91;4&#93; backed by Iran,&#91;10&#93;&#91;11&#93;&#91;3&#93; and widely considered part of the Iranian-led Axis of Resistance.&#91;10&#93;&#91;12&#93;&#91;13&#93; Emerging in the 1990s, they played a major role in Yemen's civil war, opposing the Presidential Leadership Council (SLC). The group took control over northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, since 2014,&#91;4&#93; The Saudi-led coalition, backed by the United States, has fought against the Houthi Movement for over a decade. Since the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, they have continued to target commercial shipping in the Red Sea using missiles, drones, and explosive-laden boats, forcing many shipping companies to reroute vessels around southern Africa at higher costs, in an attempt to force a ceasefire in the Gaza War and an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.&#91;4&#93;&#91;14&#93; Since November 2023, they have conducted over 190 attacks on shipping,&#91;5&#93; sunk two vessels, seized another, and killed at least four seafarers, disrupting global trade.&#91;3&#93; The Economist reported that Red Sea cargo shipments had decreased by 70% in volume as a result of these strikes. By requesting payments from shipowners in exchange for safe passage, the Houthis have reportedly turned their strikes into a business model, generating substantial revenue through blackmarket transactions and a form of maritime extortion.&#91;13&#93; The Houthis also conducted ballistic missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities, including Eilat and Tel Aviv, where a drone strike killed one Israeli.&#91;6&#93;&#91;7&#93; In response, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel, with support from a multi-national coalition,&#91;15&#93; launched attacks in Yemen to disrupt their capabilities.&#91;8&#93;&#91;5&#93; While other members of Iran's Axis of Resistance—including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Syria—suffered major setbacks, the Houthis have leveraged Yemen's geography to continue to fight against the Presidential Leadership Council.&#91;13&#93;&#91;3&#93; Following a cease-fire in Gaza-Israel in January 2025, they halted their attacks, but tensions resurfaced when they warned to resume strikes on targets in Israel if Israel disrupted humanitarian aid to Gaza again, which it blocked on 2 March. Following the aid block, the Houthis set a 4-day deadline for border crossings to be reopened and aid to be allowed. The Houthis announced a resumption in attacks on 11 March after the demands were not met.&#91;16&#93; The Houthis also fired a missile at a US Air Force F-16 and claimed to have shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone. The US administration redesignated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization in January 2025.&#91;4&#93; In February 2025, CBS News reported that President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had rolled back constraints on American commanders, allowing them to authorize airstrikes and special operations raids outside conventional battlefields. This broadened the range of people who could be targeted, with the Houthis being among the first under the new rule.&#91;17&#93; Weapons analysts have suggested that the Houthis may have acquired advanced drone technology, potentially increasing their operational range. Many of the militia's weapons are either manufactured in underground facilities or smuggled from Iran,&#91;4&#93; their primary backer. Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels remains a major international concern. Meanwhile, economic hardship in Iran has fueled domestic unrest.&#91;3&#93; Strikes[edit] 15 March[edit] Trump authorized the attack plan, which had been in development for several weeks, with the final order issued on Saturday, 15 March. Select members of Congress received briefings from the White House the same day.&#91;14&#93; The strikes, which US officials described as the largest military attack of Trump's second term, were carried out by fighter jets from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS&#160;Harry S. Truman, stationed in the northern Red Sea, and United States Air Force attack planes and armed drones launched from regional bases.&#91;4&#93; The BBC reported that the UK did not participate in the airstrikes but assisted in refueling.&#91;16&#93; At least 40 air raids took place targeting sites across Yemen, mainly the capital, Sanaa, and Saada Governorate. In Sanaa, eight strikes took place, including one on a residential area that killed 15 people and injured nine others.&#91;18&#93; Other sites hit in the capital included the Sanaa International Airport, which houses a major military facility, with images showing black smoke billowing over the area,&#91;8&#93; and the Geraf neighborhood of Shouab district in northern Sanaa, where four strikes occurred.&#91;19&#93;&#91;8&#93; Al-Masirah and other local media reported airstrikes in Sanaa at 1:30&#160;p.m. ET.&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93; Twelve strikes hit Saada, including one on a power station in Dahyan that caused a power outage.&#91;18&#93; Military installations in Taiz were also struck.&#91;3&#93;&#91;22&#93; In Kahza, Ibb Governorate, Houthi media reported that 15 people were killed after American attacks hit two residential buildings.&#91;18&#93; Eight strikes took place in Al Bayda Governorate, and further attacks hit Dhamar Governorate, Hajjah Governorate, and Marib Governorate.&#91;23&#93;&#91;18&#93; The Houthis have described the attacks as a "war crime" and vowed retaliation.&#91;3&#93; According to the Houthi-run health ministry, at least 53 people were killed, including five children and two women, and 98 others were wounded.&#91;1&#93; The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) independently determined that at least 2 children were killed in the attack.&#91;2&#93; UNICEF Yemen @UNICEF_Yemen The UN verified that at least 2 boys aged 6 &amp; 8 were among those killed by the airstrikes that targeted northern Saada 2 nights ago. A 3rd child was injured &amp; the condition of a 4th child is yet to be confirmed. UNICEF calls for the protection of children &amp; civilians at all times 17 March 2025&#91;24&#93; US national security advisor Michael Waltz claimed that the attacks killed several Houthi leaders and indicated that the US would consider hitting Iranian targets in Yemen.&#91;25&#93; 16 March[edit] Airstrikes hit military headquarters, weapon storage facilities, and detection equipment used to locate shipping.&#91;26&#93; 17 March[edit] Houthi-aligned Saba News Agency reported that two air raids took place in the port city of Al Hudaydah in the early morning, hitting a cotton ginning factory and the command cabin of the hijacked Israel-linked cargo ship Galaxy Leader.&#91;27&#93; Saba also reported strikes on an under construction cancer facility in Saada, causing major damage.&#91;28&#93; Joint Staff Director for Operations Alex Grynkewich said that over 30 targets in Yemen were struck since the bombing campaign began, killing dozens of Houthi militants.&#91;26&#93;&#91;29&#93; In the night, Al Masirah reported that US airstrikes hit the Al-Habashi Iron Factory and sites south of the presidential compound in Sanaa.&#91;30&#93; 18 March[edit] Agence France-Presse was told by witnesses that three strikes were conducted in Saada in the late night.&#91;31&#93; 19 March[edit] Houthi media reported that at least 10 strikes were conducted by the US in Sanaa and Al Hudaydah.&#91;31&#93; Strikes also took place in As Safra, Saada, which is reportedly one of the most militarized Houthi strongholds, containing training bases and weapon storage facilities. According to Reuters, trenches and bunkers that were built to house Houthi leaders following former president Joe Biden's airstrikes in Yemen were also struck, forcing the group's leadership into hiding.&#91;32&#93; US strikes on Sanaa injured seven women and two children in a residential neighborhood.&#91;33&#93; 20 March[edit] Al Masirah reported that at least four US strikes hit the Al Mina district of Al Hudaydah.&#91;34&#93; Reactions[edit] United States[edit] President Donald Trump claimed the Houthis were waging a campaign of "piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones",&#91;14&#93; and vowed to use "overwhelming lethal force" until Houthi attacks on shipping cease, declaring that "No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World."&#91;8&#93; Trump sent threats and claimed that: "Your time is up, and your attacks must stop, starting today. If they don't, hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before."&#91;14&#93; He also warned Iran to end its support for the Houthis, promising to hold the country "fully accountable" for the actions of the militant group.&#91;8&#93;&#91;14&#93; US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted on X that "Houthi attacks on American ships &amp; aircraft (and our troops!) will not be tolerated; and Iran, their benefactor, is on notice," adding that "freedom of navigation will be restored."&#91;3&#93; On March 17, Trump declared in a post that any future Houthi attacks would be viewed as direct actions by Iran, warning that Iran would be held accountable and face severe consequences.&#91;9&#93; Yemen[edit] The Houthi political bureau called the attacks a war crime.&#91;3&#93; Deputy head of the Houthi media office Nasruddin Amer said that "Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges."&#91;35&#93; Another senior Houthi member told Al Arabiya said that the attacks violated Yemen's sovereignty and would be met with a "painful and deterrent" response.&#91;36&#93; On 18 March, the pro-Houthi Yemeni Armed Forces stated that "the US aggression will not deter the steadfast and struggling Yemen from fulfilling its religious, moral, and humanitarian duties toward the Palestinian people," and reiterated the Houthis' demand for Israel to lift the blockade against the Gaza Strip.&#91;37&#93; The UN-recognized Presidential Leadership Council urged the international community to strengthen cooperation and adopt a comprehensive strategy to counter the Houthi militias and block their funding. The PLC stated that US strikes signaled a shift in the international approach to the Houthis, emphasizing that their threat now extends beyond Yemen and its neighbors, endangering global security and stability.&#91;38&#93; On 17 March, tens of thousands of protesters marched in support of the Houthis in Sanaa, Saada, Dhamar, Al Hudaydah, and 'Amran.&#91;39&#93; Houthi military response[edit] On 16 March, the Houthis stated that they fired 18 ballistic and cruise missiles and a drone at USS&#160;Harry S. Truman and its carrier strike group.&#91;1&#93; A US official claimed that 11 drones were intercepted by F-16 and F-18 fighter jets, while a Houthi missile malfunctioned and landed in the water.&#91;40&#93; On the morning of 17 March, the Houthis claimed another strike on USS Harry S. Truman and surrounding warships, consisting of 18 missiles and a drone.&#91;28&#93; On the morning of 18 March, the Houthis claimed a third attack on the aircraft carrier and surrounding warships, which US general Alexus Grynkewich said was hard to confirm since their attacks "were missing their targets by over 100 miles".&#91;30&#93;&#91;41&#93; A fourth attack on the aircraft carrier, consisting of cruise missiles and drones, was claimed by the Houthis on 19 March.&#91;42&#93; Middle East[edit] Following the attacks, commander-in-chief of the IRGC Hossein Salami stated that the Houthis acted independently from Iran, and warned that "Iran will respond decisively and destructively if they take their threats into action," referring to Trump's threats against the country. The Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the attacks a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said that America had no authority over Iran's foreign policy.&#91;3&#93; The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, condemned the US strikes on Yemen as a "crime that must be stopped."&#91;43&#93; In a letter to the UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, Iran's permanent representative Amir Saeed Iravani stated that Trump and other US officials have made "reckless and provocative statements" containing "baseless accusations" and threats of force against Tehran. He dismissed claims made by Trump regarding Iranian support to the Houthis, accusing the US president of attempting to "unlawfully justify acts of aggression and war crimes against Yemen." He warned that any aggression against Iran would have severe consequences, for which the US would be fully accountable, and urged the Security Council to take serious note of inflammatory statements and ensure compliance with the UN Charter.&#91;44&#93;&#91;45&#93;&#91;46&#93; A Saudi official has denied reports claiming Riyadh is providing logistical support for US attacks on Yemen. Speaking to Al-Arabiya, the official dismissed the allegations as "misleading" and stated that the kingdom is not supplying oil for the military operations.&#91;47&#93; The dismissal comes after reports that the UK assisted in refueling US fighter jets over Saudi Arabian airspace, while the Houthis have vowed to take action "against any country that cooperates with the American enemy."&#91;16&#93;&#91;48&#93; Lebanese militant group Hezbollah issued a statement condemning the attacks.&#91;49&#93; Iraq's Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba also condemned the attacks and vowed to respond.&#91;50&#93; Global[edit] Keir Starmer's government confirmed that the United Kingdom had provided support for strikes in Yemen through "routine allied air-to-air refuelling".&#91;51&#93; Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called for dialogue and a de-escalation, while affirming China's position against a military escalation in the region.&#91;52&#93; Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called for an end to the strikes and urged for diplomatic talks to find a peaceful solution during a call with his US counterpart Marco Rubio.&#91;53&#93; North Korean Ambassador to Egypt, Ma Dong-hee, who is also accredited to Yemen, condemns the attacks as a US threat to regional and global order.&#91;54&#93; United Nations secretary-general António Guterres called for a cessation of military activities in the region and warned that an escalation could destabilize Yemen and worsen the nation's humanitarian situation.&#91;55&#93; See also[edit] 30 May 2024 Yemen strikes Iran–Houthi relations Iran and state-sponsored terrorism References[edit] ^ a b c "Houthis claim retaliation as US says its strikes to continue in Yemen".
